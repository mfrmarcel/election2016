# Florida

Election data was collected from the Palm Beach, Osceola, Orange, Okeechobee, Monroe, Miami-Dade, Lee, Hillsborough, Hendry, Collier, and Broward County Election websites for 2016 and 2012.

Latino registered voter data was collected, when available, from each county's last book closing report (before the 2016 election) either via the county election website or via phone request. The numbers reflect number of active registered Latinos out of total active registered voters in each precinct.
